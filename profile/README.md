# The GitHub account for fisheries analyses created by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Sport Fisheries.

The Division of Sport Fisheries is in the process of transitioning it's analyses to GitHub. Consequently, not all of our analysis are visible on GitHub at this time. In addition, some analysis are maintained in private repositories. If you don't see a repository you are looking for please ask adam.reimer@alaska.gov.

GitHub repositories can be cross referenced with our publications through each repositories README file, which will contain a reference to the most recent report and/or operational plan associated with the analysis. The README will also contain information about the folder/file structure associated with the repository. Pleas note some files mentioned in the README will not be included in the public facing repository when privacy or file size issue prohibit their inclusion.

Repositories in under this account also use topics to aid in searching what you need. Each repository will have at least 3 topics; 1) the region of the state where the analysis occurred, 2) the species of fish studies, and 3) the type of analysis conducted.
